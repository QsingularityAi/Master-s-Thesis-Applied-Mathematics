# Masterâ€™s Thesis :- Cubic B-Spline Collocation Method for Parabolic Partial Differential Equations.

Project description:- The aim of this Dissertation is to investigate the features of the numerical solution of parabolic partial differential equations(one-dimensional heat Equations). In this thesis, we saw the advantage of B-spline Collocation method in numerical Process. Which is provide a high order of accuracy to understand in many physical Process.
